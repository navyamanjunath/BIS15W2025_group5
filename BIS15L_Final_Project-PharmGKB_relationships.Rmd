## Project Goals
1. How does Gene ABCB1 associate with different diseases?
2. How strong is the evidence for the association between Variant X and different disease?  

##Resources  
- [Warfarin data](https://www.pharmgkb.org/downloads)  

## Install the packages
```{r}
if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager")){
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install("biomaRt")
```

## Load the libraries
```{r}
library(biomaRt)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

require(janitor)
```

## Data

```

```{r}
names(relations)
glimpse(relations)
```

##Gene vs Disease
##Gene ABCB1 Analysis

#Find the most common gene as entity 1.
```{r}
relations %>% 
  filter(entity1_type == "Gene") %>% 
  count(entity1_name, sort = T)

# The most common gene appears to be ABCB1!
```

#Filter the data set to have only the data we want.
```{r}
filtered_relations <- relations %>% 
  select(-pk, -pd) %>% 
  filter(entity1_name == "ABCB1" & entity2_type == "Disease" & association == "associated")
filtered_relations
```

#Count the number of diseases
```{r}
disease_count <- filtered_relations %>% 
  count(entity2_name, sort = T)
```

#Categorize the diseases
```{r}
disease_count <- disease_count %>%
  mutate(Category = case_when(
    grepl("cancer|carcinoma|lymphoma|tumor", entity2_name, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Cancer",
    grepl("diabetes", entity2_name, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Metabolic",
    grepl("hypertension|cardiac|coronary|arrhythmia", entity2_name, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Cardiovascular",
    grepl("autism|attention deficit|nervous system", entity2_name, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Neurological",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))

# Count number of diseases per category
category_counts <- disease_count %>%
  count(Category, sort = TRUE)

# Plot disease categories

# ABCB1 is associated with a wide variety of diseases that donâ€™t fit into common categories like cancer, cardiovascular, neurological, or metabolic diseases.

# ABCB1 is known for its role in drug transport and multidrug resistance, meaning it might be linked to diverse conditions rather than a specific disease class.

# to show evidence type, filter out clinical or variant, focus with cancer
```

#Analyze cancer
```{r}
# Filter cancer-related diseases and exclude "clinical" or "variant" evidence types
cancer_evidence <- filtered_relations %>%
  mutate(Category = case_when(
    grepl("cancer|carcinoma|lymphoma|tumor", entity2_name, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Cancer",

    grepl("hypertension|cardiac|coronary|arrhythmia", entity2_name, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Cardiovascular",
    grepl("autism|attention deficit|nervous system", entity2_name, ignore.case = TRUE) ~ "Neurological",
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  )) %>%
  filter(Category == "Cancer")
```


#Get the Table for cancer associated with its evidence
```{r}
cancer_disease_evidence <- cancer_evidence %>%
  select(entity2_name, evidence) %>%
  arrange(entity2_name)

# View the first few rows
head(cancer_disease_evidence)

# Count number of times each (disease, evidence) pair appears
cancer_disease_evidence_counts <- cancer_evidence %>%
  count(entity2_name, evidence, sort = TRUE)

# Check the counts
head(cancer_disease_evidence_counts)
```

#Plotting the result
```{r}
ggplot(cancer_disease_evidence_counts, aes(x = evidence, y = n, fill = evidence)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +

       x = "Disease",
       y = "Number of Associations",
       fill = "Evidence Type") +

# Basically different types of Lymphoma are clinical+variant associated, and carcinoma is variant associated.
```

#PI Chart

#Conclusion
```{r}
# Basically Lymphoma is more well supported by clinical and variant evidence, and is linked to the gene of interest. It implies that there is a strong genetic link between Lymphoma and ABCB1.
```

The presence of the variant rs1045642 gene is most associated with having a disease out of all the other variant genes.
