## Project Goals
1. How does Gene ABCB1 associate with different diseases?
2. How strong is the evidence for the association between Variant X and different disease?  

##Resources  
- [Warfarin data](https://www.pharmgkb.org/downloads)  

## Load the libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)
```

#Data
```{r}
relations <- read_tsv("data/relationships.tsv") %>% clean_names()
```

#Dataframe with only variant genes and diseases
```{r}
variant_disease <- relations %>% 
  filter(entity1_type == "Variant" & entity2_type == "Disease")
```

#Percentage of association between variant genes and diseases
```{r}
pa_variant_disease <- variant_disease %>% 
  group_by(association) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(percentage = (count / sum(count)) * 100) %>% 
  arrange(-count)
pa_variant_disease 
```

#Graph of percentage of association between variant genes and diseases
```{r}
ggplot(pa_variant_disease, aes(x = "", y = percentage, fill = association)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1) +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  labs(title = "Percentage of Association Types between Variant Genes and Diseases",
       fill= "Type of Association") +

#Which gene is most associated with having a relationship with a disease?
```{r}
variant_disease %>% 
  group_by(entity1_name) %>%
  filter(association == "associated") %>% 
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  mutate(percentage = (count / sum(count)) * 100) %>% 
  arrange(-percentage)
```
The presence of the variant rs1045642 gene is most associated with having a disease out of all the other variant genes.

#Gives alternate more of quantitative result: how many of these associations are each type of evidence
```

#assign priority/ranking to each evidence type based off of clinical vs. variant vs. both annotation â€” make a plot based off of that (NOT BAR)
